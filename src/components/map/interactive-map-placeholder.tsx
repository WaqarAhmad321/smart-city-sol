// This file will be replaced by map-view.tsx
// Ensure this file is deleted or map-view.tsx is created with the new content.
// For the purpose of this operation, assume this file is effectively replaced by the content of map-view.tsx.
// If the tool requires this file to be explicitly deleted, a separate <delete file="..."> operation would be needed.
// However, by providing new content for 'src/components/map/map-view.tsx', the old placeholder is implicitly replaced if renamed.
// To be safe, let's empty it, assuming the build process handles the rename/new file correctly.
